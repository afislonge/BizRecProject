            "|-09Oc2D14vRnmirPh0vlXw|I really wish I could give 4 stars for this Cracker Barrel. If this was just on food I would hands down give 4 stars. However this is all on service. This review comes after 20 plus times coming here. The food is always consistently good the service is consistently slow and not good. If it was packed I would understand but I come on Monday or Wed nights when it's not busy at all. It takes forever to get drinks this time 15 minutes after ordering. Food took over 40 min and didn't even get it right. Took 25 min to just get a cup of soup. Not sure how much I can take coming to this location with this bad of service. Maybe try my hand at ordering to go. Didn't even get plates when they brought out the corn bread and biscuits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-0TffRSXXIlBYVbb5AwfTg|I went to indieblue a few years ago for happy hour, and found it pretty lack luster at the time. But our last few visits were great. The food was creative and tasty (just stay way from the chicken and waffles, or you'll be really disappointed), that every time I come back  I like to branch out on the menu to be surprised. \\n\\nThe drinks were really good, and the service was phenomenal. The staff all around was extremely friendly  and welcoming, gave samples of new drinks they were trying out, made accommodations for our toddlers without being asked, and we really enjoyed our time there.\\n\\nSo it's made a spot on the few restaurants we place on rotation for our nights out,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-0TffRSXXIlBYVbb5AwfTg|Let's get right into it.... OVERRATED!!! I reserved for a party of five, but one person backed only to at the last minute to only change their mind and decided to come... I explained this to the hostess who was getting upset and seemed distressed she had to move plates from one table to another.... The Food was just alright... I am half indian and have eat Indian food all my life from various places... Everyone at the table even noticed the over use of salt to mask, or show that maybe this food is not fresh and probably from a can... Please read the reviews careful as I did not... Most people have gone here for happy hour and probably got so trashed the food tasted great after acouple of drinks...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |positive |1.0                |food_quality    |\n",
            "|-0TffRSXXIlBYVbb5AwfTg|This is a fabulous restaurant (with a terrible name...gotta say I judged them for that at first). This place does true Indian fusion and pulls it off well! With a group of four, we ordered 3-4 small plates, 2 half-sized vegetarian entrees and one full sized meat entree. While the portions looked small (we literally laughed when they brought out our very tasty half portion of squash), we all left feeling full and happy. Some highlights were the spinach chaat (amazing! crispy!) and the naan pizza. Great cocktails too. \\n\\nThe food is better than Bindi and its less pretentious and more interesting than Tashan. Seriously. A new favorite in midtown village.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |positive |0.0                |food_quality    |\n",
            "|-0jzoPt3UeXn6FUXVQvyPg|Stopped by for first thursday and man they have a great deal. They offer 50% off appetizers and boise beers. The beer came out to 2.25 a bottle and the meat cheese plate was 10$. We also got an order of the flat bread which came out to 6$!!! It's too bad they only do this the first thursday of the month for the boise first thursday because it is a great deal you don't want to miss! This place is pretty fancy and more on the high scale end. Best part about this place, it's totally affordable! \\n\\nThe service from the place was a five star. Our waiter was nothing but polite, awesome, and knowledgeable. He was on point with refills and any needs. \\n\\nThe meat and cheese plate was amazing. the variety and assortment was well balanced with your different choices of meat and some side pickled items. \\n\\nGreat place to check out and would recommend it to anyone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",

Tender pieces of beef and the side of hot sauce made it even better. The 3 pepper chicken was okay but not something to order again. For the price plus a side of soup was a good deal for lunch. The happy hour specials would be something to come back too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",

Just keep your expectations in the middle and you're good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-1PG6k_iezwJmRZLB7f6og|\"What an adorable place!! In the town of zionsville it is very enchanting, little lights all over with nice chandelier and other unique decor. Let's be honest, very comparable to the cake bake shop in zionsville, and exact same concept. I had been trying to come here for months but their limited hours make it tough when I live 25 min away. Closed on mondays and closed by 8/9 Tuesday-Saturday. \\nWe got lemon bars ($4.50) which were very good and one of their \"\"boozy\"\" red velvet milkshakes ($13) Very unique and delicious! Their cakes are made by flying cupcake. We were hungry but the menu items were either too expensive or not really what we were in the mood for. I know they've expanded their menu to brunch so maybe that'll change in the future. Until then 8$ for a basket of French fries doesn't seem reasonable at all.\\nOverall I feel that it got 3 stars because I dont think these prices are worth it. Maybe start a happy hour?? Service and environment was very nice!! a good spot to come for a celebration or special occasion.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-1q9ktAQXpgFSNrst7tzag|Love me some quick Indian food! The food was great, it was quick, and the price was very reasonable. They don't give you a huge portion, which I actually liked because they stuck to what the size of a meal really should be. I'll be coming back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |positive |1.0                |food_quality    |\n",
            "|-1q9ktAQXpgFSNrst7tzag|Spice Box was my choice by default initially (at an event where the other truck was out of most things). Man, that was my lucky day because this truck is awesome.  I've eaten at about a dozen of the Indy food trucks and this is me new favorite.  It's sad to think how many times I passed this place up.  I ordered the Bollywood and it was an excellent combo meal that gives you a little sampling.  My only knock is that the menu descriptions don't translate we'll conceptually (in that you might feel like you are ordering blind).  Can't wait to try the Spice Box Truck again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-2-ih3mE8KPyeKVIzpBfPQ|Finding a traditional beer garden way up on top of this building was amazing!  The beer selection was great, true to Octoberfest tradition.  While the appetizers were predictable, they were very tasty.  The wings had great spice and the fries with gravy and cheese were delicious.  Best of all were the views of the city as the sun set!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |positive |1.0                |other           |\n",
            "|-2VYztMXVorktljCdQNPmQ|I have never had authentic Indian food before -  until now.  \\nMy oldest daughter suggested that we try this restaurant.  \\nSince we are both avid Yelpers, we checked this place out beforehand, and were\\npleasantly surprised that it placed fairly high and consistent in ratings stemming from almost 50 reviews.  \\nThat was a good start anyway. \\nAs noted in many of the other reviews, this restaurant is tucked away within a side strip mall that is also deeply tucked away from the beaten path.  It is small, and is absolutely beyond bare bones as far as the general atmosphere and decor.  It is basically stripped and barren as far as the ambience goes.   The chairs are uncomfortable, and the tables are cheap and plain.   They are covered with what I would guess is butcher paper (because it is also a butcher shop),  and they just remove the sheets of paper each time a customer finishes dining and leaves. \\n\\nThe service is sketchy and minimal.  It was unclear who our server really was. We just kept trying to get the attention of anyone that walked by our table to get whatever we needed.  They never really checked on us adequately to see if we needed anything or to confirm that the food was OK, or if we needed anything - like drink refills or more napkins - the bottom line basics.  \\nThere seemed to be an attitude of indifference that we were even there.  It was tough to get our drinks at first.  They have a cooler by the front door in which the server vaguely pointed to and suggested that we could walk over and get a drink from there.   Really? Were we supposed to assume to know that?  That was strange,... and finally I thought,....damn.   \\n\\n\\nWe just ended up ordering water regardless.  \\nI am unclear if the servers that were around us could speak any amount of English, or if they just pretended that they couldn't.  The whole exchange had a slight patronizing  air about it. There was a clear communication disconnect.  \\nWhen it was time to order, we just ended up pointing at the menu selections to let the server know what we wanted.  It was a bit uncomfortable overall.   \\n\\n\\nThe food was good for the most part.  \\nThat is what propels me to give this restaurant a  3  star - A-OK rating.  \\nUnfortunately, the portions were paltry as far as half of the dishes we ordered.   We ordered - 4 chicken dishes which were paltry in the amount of chicken that was in them, because 3 of them had more than a generous amount of sauce; or simply said : the chicken was literally swimming/drowning in a sea of sauce.  The dishes we ordered did not come with rice (except for one), which was odd and disappointing.  We ended up ordering a few large bowls of rice regardless. \\nThe naan bread was great, and was a definite highlight to the meal.  You know you are eating good bread when you don't necessarily need butter to enhance its flavor.  Besides, it was great for dipping into the various seas of sauce as well.   :o) I can honestly say the naan bread helps solidify the 3 star rating.  \\nI didn't care for the lamb dish we ordered.  The spice combination yielded a little too much clove; and for my own personal taste, a little clove goes a really long way.  \\n\\nIf I ever get their food again, I will order take out, and make my own basamati rice at home.   If I could suggest a decent dish, the butter chicken was my personal fave.  It was slightly hot and spicy, but fell short of not being 'ripping you a bigger one' hot and spicy.  \\n\\nI had a slight uneasy and awkward feeling while dining there.  I truly felt like I just didn't belong there.   It's such a shame when one doesn't feel 100% comfortable in any given or particular business establishment.  If I were to have ordered by pickup only, I might have given them 4 stars.  But, cordial and sharp service is important to me, so three stars is all I can muster at this time.|positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",

            "|-3-6BB10tIWNKGEF0Es2BA|I ordered the spicy tofu beef the Kung POW chicken and Boba matcha mango latte ... it was a lot of food.. could feel 4 with two orders. This is the best Asian food I have ever had!!!! I recommend everything I ordered OMG it was soo good. And I hate Asian food lol I'm sorry to be so blunt but I thought I did. It turns out I just hate Americanized Asian food. Cant stand Panda Express etc... there are clear vegetables and spices and mixes of flavors in these dishes. Thanks for being such a delicious place to eat. I ordered through door dash. And the packaging was perfect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |positive |0.0                |food_quality    |\n",
            "|-3xX_IfttKjPJ792BOBJ-Q|I have eaten here for the past 5 years now and have always had a great experience. However... Recently this restaurant has undergone new management and I have had a horrible experience both times I went since the new opening. First time eating here after new management took over, service and food was so bad the entire group I was with walked out and left our burned, overcooked meals on the table. I gave it 3 months to get better hoping they just needed to get the skeletons out of the closet BUT low and behold my second meal was just as bad. Every piece of chicken was burnt to a crisp and my spam musubi was hard as a rock. Im very disappointed and really wish this was not the case but this food is so bad. I feel it is wrong to not warn people what they are getting into before they go here.

            "|-5ivHc7R7F_fHxTtxGvlgA|An interesting place to either eat out or dine in. This atmosphere is welcoming and dim lighting with simple radio music. At least they do better than Tokyo Express, that is my opinion. The food is different, I ordered the dragon eyes rolls or what seemed to be like it. I found the sauce to be light and not exactly spicy like the others I have tried before. The bento box is the same like every other place which is fine. Sushi presentation is great. I'd give it another try, maybe I should try something different who knows. Staff is friendly and parking is cramped due to stores nearby. You can find more room around the building if your willing to walk a little further. \\nRecommended for anyone looking to try a new sushi place or possibly a date night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |positive |1.0                |customer_service|\n",

We will be back soon!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
            "|-8iATYRnN46Km0_-ldx6cg|Love Pace!!!  It's our go-to restaurant here in SB - never disappoints.  Love the casual/bohemian atmosphere.  Their food is always SO GOOD.  For me it's hard to depart from their grilled cheese deluxe, and my husband rarely ever orders anything but the sloppy joe w/ mac n cheese.  Also had the famous Papa Burger, which I can confirm is up there with best burgers I've ever had.  Pace does comfort food right.  We've always had friendly service.  Come hungry!  One thing that I'd like to see them do is to vary up their menu or specials a bit more - it's not a big menu and they've had the same dishes on it for quite a while.  Just want to try more awesome different meals from them!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |positive |0.0                |customer_service|\n",
